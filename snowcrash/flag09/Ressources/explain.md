# LEVEL 09

In our home directory, we see an executable with suid/guid and a token file that we can read but which content seems encrypted:
```
>$ ls -l
total 12
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag09 level09 7640 Mar  5  2016 level09
----r--r-- 1 flag09 level09   26 Mar  5  2016 token
>$ cat token
f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��
```
We know the file expects an argument:
```
>$ ./level09
You need to provide only one arg.
```
Let's figure out what the executable does:
```
>$ ./level09 token
tpmhr
>$ ./level09 hello
hfnos
>$ ./level09 hi
hj
```
the executable expects a string as an argument, and encodes it by rotating each character by an incrementing index.
for example: `token`
```
t  o  k  e  n
+0 +1 +2 +3 +4
t  p  m  h  r
```
If this file was used to encrypt the password in the token file, maybe we can provide our own program to reverse it.
We create a simple C file `decrypt.c` to decrypt this:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int ac, char **argv)
{
	if (ac != 2)
		return (0);
	int i = -1;
	while (argv[1][++i])
		argv[1][i] -= i;
	printf("Flag09 password bach nakhdu l flag : %s\n", argv[1]);
	return (1);
}
```
Let's save the VM level09 token to our local machine:
```
➜ scp -P 4242 level09@{VM_IP}:token token

[... VM prompt for level09 password...]
password: 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f

➜ ls
decrypt.c token
➜ chmod 755 token
```
Then we compile `decrypt.c` and run with the token to find the decrypted password:
```
➜ gcc decrypt.c -o decrypt
➜ ./decrypt `cat token`
Flag09 password : f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
```
Let's use this to log into flag09:
```
>$ su flag09
Password: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
Don't forget to launch getflag !
>$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z
```

* Breakable encryption algorithm => reverse engineering
