# LEVEL 14

There is nothing in our home directory.
so we'll have to find a vulnerability in the getflag binary itself using gdb:
```
>$ gdb getflag
(gdb) r
Starting program: /bin/getflag 
You should not reverse this
```

Lets copy the getflag binary outside of the vm:

>âžœ scp -P 4242 scp://level14@{VM_IP}/../../../bin/getflag getflag


Then we will inspect it using: https://onlinedisassembler.com/static/home/index.html
We find 15 calls to ft_des function, maybe these could correspond to the 15 flags.
Let's have a look at the corresponding memory addresses in gdb. Create a breakpoint in the main, run it, and jump to memory address:
```
>$ gdb getflag
(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x804894a
(gdb) r
Starting program: /bin/getflag

Breakpoint 1, 0x0804894a in main ()
(gdb) ju *0x8048BF3
Continuing at 0x8048bf3.
x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
```
Great, that's the flag for level00. Searching through the 15 addresses we find:
```
(gdb) ju *0x8048DE5
Continuing at 0x8048de5.

Congratulation. Type getflag to get the key and send it to me the owner of this livecd :)

#### Vulnerability:
* Weak anti-debugging technique and available gdb => privilege escalation by manipulating registers
