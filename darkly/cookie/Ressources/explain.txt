using the python script we can see that a cookie is set by the website:
{'I_am_admin': '68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327'}

after testing on different hashs algos, we can see that it's a md5 hash which digest is 'false'.
so we change it to 'true': b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09 and we test again 
after refresh an alert pops the flag.

use the website below to verify the hash:
https://md5decrypt.net/

for more secure:
1 . do not put critical information in cookies.
2 . use high encrypted cookies with private signature like JWT or any other
