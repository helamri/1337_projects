Since the website is hosted in a linux server
and the global structure of the linux servers have the password of the session and machine in /etc/passwd (recently is changed to /etc/shadow)

for that w'll try to find the correct path of etc/passwd in the server depending on where the website is stored in the machine by trying multiple paths starting from :
?page=/etc/passwd
?page=../etc/passwd
?page=../../etc/passwd
....
?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

the number of ‘../’ depends on location of the target web server.

we get a special popup with a different message everytime we add a '../' following with 'etc/passwd'.
we add mulitple '../' till we find the correct location which contains informations about the users.

then we get the flag.
- Correct path : `?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

to have more fun, we create a python script to do this programatically.

How to secure: 
    use a whitelist of filenames and ignore every other filename and path.
    save the file paths in a database and assign an id to each of them.
    
    in short : Prevent unwanted path to be processed
