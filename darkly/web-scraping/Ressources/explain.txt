LOCATION : /robots.txt

the `robots.txt` file is useful for finding hidden or secure paths on a website.
it is always located at the root so here `http://192.168.x.x/robots.txt`, it is a public file.
we find two restricted paths: `/whatever` and` /.hidden`.
on `http://192.168.x.x/.hidden` there is a long list of folders with subfolders, difficult to analyze manually.
to find the flag in these folders you can download all the `README` files and after identifying recurrences, exclude repetitive sentences to identify potential files that differ.
then we get the flag.

How to secure:
just like the `robots.txt` file, you can protect access to sensitive files/folders via the `.htaccess`.
