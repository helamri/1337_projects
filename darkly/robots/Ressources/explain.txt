the robots.txt file is useful for finding hidden or secure paths on a website.
It is always located at the root so here `http://192.168.x.x/robots.txt`, it is a public file.

we find two restricted paths from being crawled by the search engine bots :
     - `/whatever`
     - `/.hidden`

on `http://192.168.x.x/whatever` we find a file`htpasswd` which contains `root: 8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3`.
this seems like a super admin credentials, wich means not accesible to anyone, and the standard admin panel path for most of websites either /admin or /adminpanel

username: `root`
password (md5 decoded): `dragon`

this combination can be used to connect to the administrator panel of the site `http://192.168.x.x/admin`.

How to secure:
    add a rule in the` .htaccess` to disallow all search engine robots from indexing and crawling 
    the development environement and protect the paths that leads to it like this:
            User-agent: *
            Disallow: /
