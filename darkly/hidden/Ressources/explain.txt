If we visit the path `/index.php?page=recover` :
    - from the first look at the page we notice that there is a submit button without a form, and 
        the button submit something ofc by looking at the network panel
    - so lets inspect the html of this part
    - w'll find a form with a post method and an input with it's type equal to hidden (which means not displayed).

we have two different ways to submit this form :
- changing the html code : deleting hidden with the navigator tools. A field shows and we put a random value then submit.
- sending a request through a python code.

Lets use the second way and look at the response
by executing the python code we get a response with a flag, and that what we need

How to secure :
even by setting a costum input in client side we must validate it on the server side and secure request by encrypted token always.
